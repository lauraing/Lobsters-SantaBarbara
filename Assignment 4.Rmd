Fishing Pressure from 2012-2017 at Non-MPA Sites:


Abundance of Lobster from 2012-2017:
AQUE stays relatively consistent
CARP starts increasing after 2015, with a big spike between 2016 and 2017
IVEE increases from 2012 to 2015, decreases from 2015 and 2016, and increases again to 2017
MOHK spikes between 2014 and 2015, then steadily decreases to 2017
NAPL increases steadily between 2012 and 2015, then decreases steadily to 2017
IVEE, MOHK, and NAPL all increase in abundance between 2013 and 2015, but then all decrease to 2016. Out of these 3 sites, only IVEE rapidly increases in abundance from 2016 to 2017; the other 2 sites (MOHK & NAPL) decrease slightly.
CARP and AQUE both don't have large changes in abundance from 2012 to 2015; after 2015, AQUE abundance decreases a little, and CARP increases, with a large increase from 2016 to 2017.

# Problem 2. Compare mean lobster size by site in 2017. Compare mean lobster sizes (carapace length (mm)) across the five sites for lobster observations collected in 2017. Warning: the size data are not in tidy format. There are rows that contain size information for multiple lobsters observed (e.g., if the researcher saw 3 lobsters all with carapace length ~ 60 mm, then they will have a single row where COUNT = 3 and SIZE = 60). You’ll want to get this into case format - where each lobster has its own row - before doing statistical analyses. There are many ways to do this. One hint: function expand.dft in the vcdExtra package (it doesn’t like tibbles, so you might need to coerce to data.frame first). *Anova boxplot and error bars

3. Changes in lobster size at MPA and non-MPA sites (comparing only 2012 and 2017 sizes)
From the data description (http://sbc.lternet.edu/cgi-bin/showDataset.cgi?docid=knb-lter-sbc.77):
“Data on abundance, size and fishing pressure of California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus)
are collected along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Spiny lobsters are an
important predator in giant kelp forests off southern California. Two SBC LTER study reefs are
located in or near the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Naples
and Isla Vista, both established as MPAs on 2012-01-01. MPAs provide a unique opportunity to
investigate the effects of fishing on kelp forest community dynamics. Sampling began in 2012 and
is ongoing.”
At Isla Vista and Naples Reef, the two protected MPA sites (with zero fishing pressure), how do lobster sizes
in 2012 and 2017 compare? At the non-MPA sites?

# Problem 4. Proportions of “legal” lobsters at the 5 sites in 2017. The legal minimum carapace size for lobster is 82.6 mm. What proportion of observed lobsters at each site are above the legal minimum? Does that proportion differ significantly across the 5 sites?

```

The proportion of observed lobsters at a legal size differed significantly across the 5 sites ($\chi^2$(`r lob_x2$parameter`) = `r round(lob_x2$statistic, 2)`, p < 0.001, $\alpha$ = 0.05.) Most notably, Mohawk Reef had a higher proportion of illegal lobster size, while Naples had a higher proportion of legal lobster size compared to the rest of the 5 sites.
